# Solution1: sort by frequency+pick top k
# Time complexity: O(nlogn)
# Space complexity: O(n)

# use hash tap to store the elements frequency
# scan the array O(n)

# define a bucket, the key is frequency, the value is all the numbers with
# that specific frequency


# define ans
# scan the ans
# bucket insert elements into answer
